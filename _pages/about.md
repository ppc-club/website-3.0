# Welcome to the Rowdiest Chess Club in Brooklyn
Or possibly anywhere

#### Prospect Park Chess Club was founded in 2021 by our fearless leader Mitch.  
#### (He denies being fearless. But he's a liar. Don't trust him.) 

Prospect Park Chess Club is a more of a social club then anything else. Made up of people who like chess, parks, bars, and arguing about chess, parks, and bars.

We meet in Brooklyn to play over-the-board chess with real boards, real clocks, and varying levels of questionable decision-making. Some of us are very good. Some of us are... Not. All of us are here to have a good time.

Show up, grab a board, play a game, make a friend, lose on time, complain about it, repeat.

All levels welcome. Zero pressure. No membership. Just chess.

Rough timeline to clear up confusion:
Chess.com club founded Sep 29, 2015
Our club first started finding members Nov 16, 2021
We took over Chess.com club Feb 18, 2022

Join us for Over The Board meetups every Thursday at 6 p.m. at local bars! (Currently, we have a standing meet-up at Franklin Park)

We will also play OTB chess in various parks throughout Brooklyn weather permitting.

## Do I need to be good at chess?
Nope. Absolute beginners, casual players, and strong players are all welcome. If you know how the pieces move, you’re good enough. If you don’t, we’ll show you.

## Do I need to bring a board or clock?
No. We usually have plenty of boards and clocks floating around.

## Is this a tournament?
Nope. This is casual, over-the-board chess. Sometimes people play blitz, sometimes slower games, sometimes we analyze positions or just hang out. No pairings, no standings, no stress.

## *ARE* there tournaments?
YES. We mostly keep it free play, but if there's enough enthusiasm we will have a tournament. Usually a chess variant because we love the chaos. 

## Do I need to sign up or become a member?
Nope. There’s no sign-up, no dues, and no commitment. Just show up.

## When and where do you meet?
- **Thursdays after 6pm** at Franklin Park (indoors at the bar)
- **Tuesdays at Underhill Plaza** (seasonal / weather-dependent)
- **Weekends in Prospect Park** (interest / weather-dependent)

Check our Discord for day-of updates, especially when the weather is questionable.

## What if I show up late?
That’s totally fine. People drift in and out all night. Just grab a board and jump in.

## Is it okay to just watch?
Absolutely. Watching, chatting, and hanging out are all part of the vibe. For some people it's the whole vibe. No pressure. 

## Are kids welcome?
Yes, as long as they’re supervised and comfortable in the space (especially at bar meetups).

## Is this free?
Yes. Always.

## What if I don’t know anyone?
Most people don’t their first time. Say hi, ask for a game, and you’ll fit in fast. Go to the [newbs page](/newb/)

## How do I stay in the loop?
The best way is to join our discord... but we have other socials as well!
